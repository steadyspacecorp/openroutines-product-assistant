# The runtime for this agent.
#
# Privilege moves in one direction: base installs everything as root into system
# paths, and each final stage drops to the unprivileged agent user, which can run
# the binaries but never replace them.
#
#   base    -- OS packages and common tools, pinned opencode, the agent user.
#
#   runtime -- base, as the agent user. `openroutines routines run/test` executes
#              the model process in this stage with the run workspace mounted;
#              nothing else from your machine is visible to it.
#
#   agent   -- the deployable image and default build target: base + the pinned
#              openroutines release (the supervisor, its entrypoint) + this repository.
#              A sealed box: no ports, logs on stdout, and two secrets supplied
#              at boot through environment values or mounted at the conventional
#              /agent/master.key and /agent/deploy.key paths. Neither secret is
#              ever built into the image.

# process in its own mount, pid, ipc, uts and user namespaces, so one run
# cannot see, signal, or name anything belonging to another. It is the only
# sandbox that needs installing -- where the host will not permit those
# namespaces the supervisor falls back to a Landlock domain, which needs
# nothing but the kernel.
